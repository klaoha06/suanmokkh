						<p>Suan Mokkh is a forest monastery along the coast of Southern Thailand, 600 km from Bangkok. It was founded in 1932 by Buddhadasa Bhikkhu (see below) and grew to become the most innovative and progressive Buddhist teaching center in Siam. Although Buddhadasa Bhikkhu has passed away, much of his work continues. This site is a continuation of that work, one of many virtual Suan Mokkhs. As the true Suan Mokkh can only be found within the nature of the silent mind, any attempt to speak of it is virtual, whether in talks, books, or cyberspace. Here we attempt to extend the discoveries of Suan Mokkh into the 84,000 virtual worlds. May the contents support you in the realization of the liberation that is ever now within the nature of the mind that is experiencing this "reality," virtual or what-have-you.</p>

						<p>
							The Suan Mokkh of Buddhadasa Bhikkhu may be difficult to find in some of the activities being carried out these days in his name. This should not discourage those who sincerely seek what he sought & taught: the end of suffering through not attaching to anything as "I" or "mine." To the degree we can put this into practice, we will understand & discover "The Garden of Liberation" for ourselves, both within us and as we help reveal it in whatever place we find ourselves. It isn't necessary to seek Suan Mokkh in the place where Buddhadasa Bhikkhu once lived. Seek it wherever you are!

											<p>Suan Mokkh is located near the bulge on the
						upper Malay Peninsula that is the heart of Southern Thailand.
	
						The Gulf of Siam is not far away. From the red sandstone cliffs of Nang E Hill
						at the back of the Wat, the ocean and its tourist-catering islands are easily
						visible beyond a swamp, rice fields, and coconut palm groves. When the wind is
						right, the ocean breezes cool us; sometimes they sweep dark rain clouds down
						upon us. The Asia Highway runs past our door, north to Bangkok and south to
						Singapore. Houses spread up and down along it, forming a loose village most of
						which grew up after the Wat. All around are small rubber plantings, the dominant
						economic activity in the area. Suan Mokkh moved here around 1940 after its first
						site was outgrown. Two kilometers across the highway, screened by two limestone
						hills, forty acres of coconut groves are being developed into an international
						retreat center. The main site, less land given for a school and a Boy Scout
						camp, covers 120 acres.</p>
											<p>A Wat is a residence for bhikkhus. Bhikkhus are men who have left home to
						take up the religious life within the teaching and training of the Lord Buddha.<a href="#FNGL2" name="TXTGL2"><sup class="white">2</sup></a>
						Our Wat, centered on Golden Buddha Hill, is officially known as &quot;Wat Tarn
						Nam Lai,&quot; named after the &quot;flowing stream&quot; that runs down from
						Nang E Hill, which existed before Suan Mokkh came. The name Suan Mokkh can apply
						to the physical place also, and that is how most people understand it. Properly,
						it refers more to a place or state of mind that has realized the spiritual goal.
						The full name is Suan Mokkhabalarama, meaning &quot;The Grove of the Powers of
						Liberation,&quot; which points to the heart of spiritual inquiry and practice:
						liberation from ignorance, selfishness, and misery. Buddhadasa Bhikkhu founded
						Suan Mokkh with the help of his younger brother and some of their friends in
						1932 at a site about eight kilometers from here. <a href="#FNGL3" name="TXTGL3"><sup class="white">3</sup></a>
						He continues to head the community at the age of 85. Although much of Suan
						Mokkh's importance and uniqueness is due to the talents, inspiration, and
						controversy of its founder, this article will focus more on the community and
						the place itself.</p>
											<p>My understanding of Buddhism and Suan Mokkh is far from complete. I am just
						beginning to fathom the things I try to describe here. I have lived here only
						three and a half years and do not have direct experience of its early years.
						Further, I am a <cite>farang</cite> (foreigner of European descent). Although I
						came here after four years of service in the U.S. Peace Corps, which gave me a
						good start toward comprehending Thai language and culture, as well as time to
						adjust to subtropical weather and painfully spicy food, a <cite>farang</cite>
						never completely blends into Thai contexts. My perspectives and appraisals are
						likely to differ from those of my Thai Dhamma comrades, especially those of
						older generations.</p>
						<hr id="monastary"class="full">											
											<h2 class="text-center haveMargin" style="margin-top:30px;">THE MONASTARY AND NATURE</h2>
											<hr>
											<p>The Buddha taught about Dhamma, rather than gods or a God. <a href="#FNGL4" name="TXTGL4"><sup class="white">4</sup></a>
						He didn't describe the Supreme Thing, ultimate truth, the fundamental nature of
						everything, or whatever we might call it, in personal or anthropomorphic terms.
						Dhamma is an ancient Indian word of great importance and vitality still. The
						meanings of this word Dhamma are rich and many. For a start, Suan Mokkh
						emphasizes four primary meanings:
						
											
<ul>
														<li><small>Nature (all reality and all things)</small></li>
														<li><small>Natural law (the law of conditionality, everything happens dependent on
						    causes and conditions)</small></li>
													
														<li><small>Duty according to natural law (the duty of human beings at every step,
						    stage, and moment of their living)</small></li>
													
														<li><small>Fruit from that duty (practiced in line with natural law).</small></li>
														</ul>
											
											<p>If we wish, we can say also that Dhamma is the &quot;Buddhist God,&quot; a
						non-personal god, neither mind nor body, is Truth, is The Law. A Buddha merely
						discovers the Dhamma, nothing can create or effect it. Through a thorough
						understanding of Dhamma, the Buddha came to the realization that is the highest
						potential of humanity, the fruit of duty done perfectly - that is, selflessly -
						the end of all misery and suffering. He then honored and worshipped only this
						Dhamma. Those who follow the Buddha's path must do their best to penetrate
						through their own experience to the heart of Dhamma. A good way to begin is to
						live close to nature.</p>
											<p>Strictly speaking, everything is natural, is part of nature. But somehow the
						naturalness of asphalt, concrete, polyester, and air-conditioning do not awaken
						the heart in the same way that trees, termites, rain clouds, and mud can. If we
						are able, we try to live in an environment that brings us close to natural
						things, where man does not dominate leaving the stamp of his designs and
						desires, where natural forces work unimpeded, where natural laws reveal
						themselves easily to the patient and quiet observer.</p>
											<p>Suan Mokkh is the first forest Wat in modern Southern Thailand. Trees and
						vines are everywhere, not planted; beautiful, fresh, surprising. They were here
						first, then the Wat with its structures fit in and around. It is a privilege to
						live among trees, rocks, streams, mouse deer, langur, and gibbons, birds singing
						unseen and suddenly flashing color-movement, snakes harmless and deadly, and
						untold insects (three inch grasshopper plops onto typewriter and springs off).
						In the old days, tigers and leopards used to come down when hungry to eat a dog.
						The privilege becomes poignant as I read how the world's forests are dying of
						poison, pillage, and war, or remember the chain-saws shrieking just across the
						Wat's fence my first year here.</p>
											<p>I'm typing at a hut in the back of the Wat, one of about forty spaced 20 to
						30 meters apart. I type mainly at night by kerosene lantern. Remnants of the
						afternoon rain drip from the tree leaves, various cicadas chirp and hum in their
						chosen crescendos, termites migrate (do they mimic big city commuters or vice
						versa?), the fading moon rises. Looking up from the keyboard there is darkness,
						tree shapes, shadows, everyone's home. Regularly, I go down from this porch (the
						hut is raised four feet off the ground) to tend a fire and pour its water for
						tea or to pace barefoot on the red sandy soil laid bare around the hut,
						attending to my breath as a kind of walking meditation. Other times, when there
						is light, I walk around, stand, stoop, to observe vine shoots, ferns, mushrooms,
						mosses, chameleons, puddles, and the geopolitics of various ant races. Events,
						transformations, patterns, cycles gently manifest to the heart that seeks to be
						at peace with nature. In human society we live in the complex world of language,
						ideas, beliefs, culture. But this more simple, this ego-less world, is for us to
						live in, too. Here are constant resources for reflection and contemplation about
						life, its meaning and purpose, the ways of living, peace. Am I worthy of this
						seventy foot tree? Will I listen to its Dhamma? What do this pair of thrush
						teach through their nest building on the porch? Who is the ancient monitor
						lizard basking regally in the sun?</p>
											<p>To live our lives in peace with other people we must learn to dwell in
						natural silence. For only through an understanding of silence can we survive in
						the complex language worlds of human relationships, not getting lost and
						remaining sane, whole, healthy, unselfish. With trees we can easily enter a much
						freer dialogue where everything is open, where there are no games to put on, and
						each expression of Dhamma - including us - can be what it must be and do at that
						moment. Trees teach us how to look at each other without fear, desire, envy,
						conflict.</p>
											<p>The woods and these little huts are ideal places for meditation. In the
						Buddha's time, the Bhikkhus were wanderers who settled down only for the three
						months of the rainy season. Generally, they stayed in the countryside and woods,
						not too near villages and towns. Such wandering is more difficult now;
						&quot;civilization&quot; takes up all the space. So we gather into monastic
						communities. Still, always, we must look into our own hearts and learn there the
						Dhamma, the truth of our lives and duties. At Suan Mokkh we use a system of
						meditation taught and practiced by the Lord Buddha both before and after his
						enlightenment. It is called Mindfulness with Breathing <cite>(anapanasati)</cite>.<a href="#FNGL5" name="TXTGL5"><sup class="white">5</sup></a>
						The breath too is natural. It is soothing and vital with many lessons for
						revealing the secrets of life. No need for words and theories. Just learn from
						life itself, within ourselves.</p>
											<p>Any large monastery must have a certain number of communal buildings,
						especially any center that is dedicated, as Suan Mokkh is, to teaching large
						numbers of visitors, lay and religious. Such buildings have been built out of
						necessity, in as functional and economical way as possible. Although some are a
						bit eccentric, they fit in with the forest, each giving space to the other. But
						whenever possible, no structure was built and nature's gifts used instead. The
						best example of this is our &quot;temple&quot; <i>(uposatha)</i>, a consecrated
						area necessary in any full-fledged Wat. In Bangkok, the temples are rich,
						ornate, glittery buildings. At Suan Mokkh it is a hill scattered with rocks,
						with trees for pillars and the sky for the ceiling. A layer of sand was only
						recently added, as was the lone Buddha image, made for our fiftieth anniversary.
						It is washed by rain, cooled by the wind, and decorated by ceaselessly falling
						leaves. Lizards come and go as they please.</p>
											<p>Suan Mokkh's main lecture hall is the slope leading from the gate to the base
						of Golden Buddha Hill with the temple on its top. Rocks have been moved,
						collected, and stacked to create a terrace - rimmed by a long curved seat for
						the monks - that acts as a &quot;stage.&quot; As the auditorium spreads down the
						slope, boulders, benches, and bare sand provide seating space for thousands,
						although audiences usually range from a few dozen to a few hundred. The trees
						provide shade, background harmony, showers of leaves, towers for lights and
						electrical wires, and playgrounds for birds, monkeys, squirrels, and the cicadas
						that often compete with the sound system. Then, scattered throughout the Wat are
						clearings, circles of gathered boulders, nooks and crannies where we can chat,
						read, rest, meditate, and try to understand nature's law and our duty within it.</p>

											<h2 class="text-center haveMargin" style="margin-top:30px;">THE TEACHER AND DHAMMA</h2>
											<hr>
											<p><img src="assets/ajarn4.jpg" alt="with Avalikotesvara" align="left" hspace="9" width="250" height="362">Visitors
						usually find Ajarn Buddhadasa sitting on a bench in front of his residence. He
						is surrounded by plants, potted and wild, and by lotus ponds. Guests are invited
						to take another bench and, if willing, engage in a discussion of Dhamma.
						Chickens, cats, and dogs wander in and out, no more the owners of the place than
						anyone. Ajarn Buddhadasa is aware of the contrast with those Wats and religious
						residences where more emphasis is put on ceremony, material splendor, and
						physical comfort than on the simplicity, poverty, and message of the great
						teachers in all traditions. Sometimes he teases the experts from the government,
						United Nations, and so-called charity organizations who meet in fancy hotels and
						air-conditioned halls to discuss the problem of the poor. Only strong rains
						chase his discussions here under a roof, but not so far as to go indoors.</p>
											<p>This appreciation for nature is one of Suan Mokkh's way of honoring all
						Buddhas (the Ones Who Know, the Awakened Ones). The man who came to be called
						&quot;The Lord Buddha&quot; was born outdoors, in a grove of trees, on the
						ground. All the major events of his life happened in similar circumstances: the
						Great Awakening under the Bodhi tree, the first sermon in the Deer Park at
						Isipatana, and the passing into <cite>parinibbana</cite> <a href="#FNGL6" name="TXTGL6"><sup class="white">6</sup></a>
						at his body's dissolution. Many hours of , untold miles walking through the
						Indian countryside, and forty-five years of tireless teaching mostly took place
						outdoor, beneath trees, on the earth (perhaps with a pile of leaves or grass
						covered by a simple cloth as a seat). Nor was the Buddha unique in this
						closeness with nature. Christ, Mohammed, Lao Tzu, and most of the &quot;Ones Who
						Know&quot; spent much of their time in the &quot;desert&quot; or
						&quot;wilderness.&quot; And what of their disciples living in this world of
						petroleum derivatives, steel, and silicon wafers? The Buddha's advice remains
						the same. Bhikkhus, these bases of trees, these quiet places, you ought to
						practice diligently. Don't be careless, don't live as a person who will have
						regrets later. <a href="#FNGL7" name="TXTGL7"><sup class="white">7</sup></a></p>
											<h3>WE MUST HELP OURSELVES</h3>
											<p>Buddhadasa Bhikkhu had six Rains when he returned from Bangkok to found Suan
						Mokkh. <a href="#FNGL8" name="TXTGL8"><sup class="white">8</sup></a> By
						then he had passed and subsequently taught the recommended basic studies and had
						begun the formal Pali studies necessary for status and advancement in the
						ecclesiastical hierarchy. Although he was dissatisfied by the worldly atmosphere
						and trappings of those studies, by their conservatism, and lack of free thought,
						he gained from them a solid enough understanding of the Buddha's teaching to go
						independent. The decadence, busyness, filth, and noise of Bangkok - even sixty
						years ago - sickened him, so he sought a proper place to put the teachings into
						practice. He moved into an abandoned Wat in the woods near the town of his birth
						and began his exploration in earnest. When younger bhikkhus and novices heard of
						Suan Mokkh and came to stay there, he required that they too have enough study
						knowledge, commitment, and maturity to be self-reliant. Basic training was
						available elsewhere; Suan Mokkh sought a deeper practice.</p>
											<p>The Buddhist analysis of the human dilemma is that we bring suffering upon
						ourselves and others through our own ignorance. The naturally pure mind is
						deceived and lured by sensual experience. Things are taken to be permanent,
						satisfying, beautiful, ownable, and most profoundly, to be selves. <a href="#FNGL9" name="TXTGL9"><sup class="white">9</sup></a>
						Viewing our lives and world in such a way, we pervert the basic experiences of
						seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and knowing (including all the
						mental processes such as thinking, feeling, remembering); along with the
						feelings (pleasant, unpleasant, and neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant) that arise
						toward those experiences; into craving, lust, hatred, delusion, worry, fear, and
						all forms of selfishness. Such deluded thinking and acting is misery, all of
						which is rooted in our own blindness and misunderstanding. Ultimately, then, the
						solution is to remove that ignorance. And if that ignorance is within our own
						hearts-minds, how could anyone else remove it for us? To depend on outside help
						is childish; we must cure ourselves.</p>
											<p>This being the case, Buddhadasa Bhikkhu set off to cure himself and never
						fell under the delusion that he could cure others. He simply wanted to study,
						practice, and penetrate to the heart of the Buddha's Dhamma, and never had
						intentions to set himself up as a teacher. Others who shared the goal were
						welcome to use this garden for their spiritual studies and experiments, but only
						as friends and equals. Although he ended up being the older brother, due to his
						knowledge and experience, he didn't dominate or tell others what to do. That
						might give them an excuse to shirk their own responsibility and become
						dependent. Even as the role of teacher came to be necessary, as Suan Mokkh grew
						and became well known, he always demanded that people think and investigate for
						themselves, rather than just memorize and believe in teachings. When and where
						he could, he has been ready and willing to be a guide and friend, but he has no
						illusions of doing more. The Buddha himself said,</p>
											<blockquote>
												<p>Striving is your own responsibility, the Tathagatas (Awakened Ones) only
						  point the way. <a href="#FNGL10" name="TXTGL10"><sup class="white">10</sup></a></p>
											</blockquote>
											<p>I emphasize this point because many monasteries, Buddhist and other, require
						strict obedience. While obedience helps to avoid selfishness and pride, and
						while obedience in worldly matters allows them to be taken care of simply and
						efficiently, there is no authority to obey in spiritual matters other than the
						Dhamma itself. One must hear and listen to Truth oneself, and obey it willingly.
						At Suan Mokkh, it is felt that one should start doing so immediately. If one
						must have it interpreted by another today, whenever will one learn to hear and
						live directly?</p>
											<p>Rather than one person try to transform another, Dhamma-Nature-Law must be
						allowed to do the work, the shaping and transforming. Here, even the selfish and
						immature are given space to grow up into unselfishness. The more knowledgeable
						and experienced should be able to watch and encourage with kindness, compassion,
						and equanimity. If too much importance is placed on conforming to some external
						form, the heart will never conform to Dhamma. Once again, this is in line with
						the Buddha's example. Rather than call himself a teacher or divine messenger or
						god, he simply claimed to be a <cite>kalyana-mitta</cite> (good, noble friend).</p>
											<p>This is not to say that one can do nothing to help another. The Middle Way
						avoids the extreme of indifference, non-caring, and insensitivity as much as it
						shuns bossiness and domination. Both extremes are forms of irresponsibility, or
						responsibility primarily to selfish impulses. True responsibility lies in
						between, in Dhamma. The spiritual guide, then, is first of all someone who has
						walked the way of Dhamma sufficiently to point out that way to others. The
						knowledge and experience gained from direct spiritual living can be expressed
						and explained in various ways to help others to discover how they too may live
						this life. And the presence of a truly unselfish, even selfless being shows
						beginners that it can be done, provides a tangible example of the teachings for
						those who have not yet found it deeply in themselves. So far, Suan Mokkh as been
						blessed with a spiritual friend who gives powerful and challenging teaching
						along with an impeccable example.</p>
											<p>Self-reliance is not thrust on people, since few of us have been prepared for
						it. Anyone coming for a long stay is expected to have completed basic studies
						first. Once here, he has many opportunities to experiment, study, and occupy
						developing minds in useful ways. Depending on individual abilities,
						proclivities, and needs, one could build one's program from activities such as
						daily chanting of scriptures, meditation, scriptural study, translation,
						teaching visitors and school children, helping with traditional ceremonies,
						community service, construction work, painting and sculpture, transcribing
						tapes, publishing, looking after guests, lectures and classes, discussions,
						physical labor, mechanical and electrical work. No one pattern is expected.
						Everyone is free to use their knowledge and skills to benefit the Wat and
						practice Dhamma. And one can change, adapt, and experiment as one needs. In
						support of this Ajarn Buddhadasa gives frequent lectures and is available for
						advice to keep everyone straight on the fundamental principles of Dhamma that
						are applied through the various activities one undertakes, if one is
						sufficiently mindful and wise.</p>

																<h2 class="text-center haveMargin" style="margin-top:30px;">RECOVERING PRISTINE BUDDHISM</h2>

											<p><img src="assets/ajarn5.jpg" alt="tan ajarn standing with cane" align="right" hspace="13" height="418">
						It does not take a very careful reading of the Buddha's discourses (or the words
						of Christ recorded in the Bible) to realize that religion nowadays is much
						different from when the Master lived. Some may say that the Religion doesn't
						begin until after the Great Teacher dies and that it's all down hill from there.
						Ajarn Buddhadasa, however, feels that the original spirit can be rediscovered or
						recaptured. To do so it is helpful to recreate the original conditions where
						possible and elsewhere adapt our modern ways to recollect and reflect how the
						Great Teacher lived and taught. Thus, many aspects of Suan Mokkh try to
						recapture the spirit and feel of &quot;Pristine Buddhism.&quot; <a href="#FNGL11" name="TXTGL11"><sup class="white">11</sup></a>
						Important examples have been discussed above.</p>
											<p>Amusingly, attempts to return to the way things were done in the early days
						are often viewed as unorthodox or heretical. People tend to take the status quo
						with which they are comfortable, rather than the original teachings, as their
						basis for comparison. They become so used to their own habits, beliefs,
						opinions, and traditions that they never stop to reflect, &quot;Is my way the
						only way?&quot; &quot;Was it always like this?&quot; &quot;How did the Buddha do
						things?&quot; Thus, many people were shocked that Suan Mokkh for many years had
						no public Buddha images and took the fact to be a sign of disrespect. The
						intention, however, was one of deep respect and understanding. Originally,
						Buddhists had the wisdom to realize that the real Buddha could never be
						portrayed in a physical medium or form. In the oldest Buddhist art, such as the
						stupas at Amaravati, Sanchi, and Barhut, there are no attempts to represent the
						Buddha as a human body. Instead, there are Bodhi trees, Dhamma Wheels, and empty
						spaces symbolizing the enlightenment, the Buddha's <cite>Dhammakaya</cite>
						(Truth-Body) and the voidness (<cite>sunyata,</cite> emptiness of self and soul,
						I and mine) realized and exemplified through perfect selflessness. It wasn't
						until Greek immigrants brought their modeling talents and religious materialism
						to India that the Buddha was turned into an image. While helpful for instilling
						faith in children, such images are the source of much confusion, which may never
						be outgrown. Thus, Suan Mokkh strives to instill a deeper understanding of
						Buddhahood from the start.</p>
											<p>Suan Mokkh tries to heal the artificial and harmful fragmentation of Buddhist
						life into disjointed pieces and practices. Spiritual practice is life, an
						organic whole; to dissect it is to disfigure and even kill it. Yet monks have
						long distinguished between a study camp of scholars and urban monasteries, and a
						practical camp of meditators and forest dwellers (either as wanderers or in
						small forest monasteries). Such a distinction didn't exist in the Buddha's time,
						although different disciplines showed varying inclinations toward solitude and
						community life, learning and mental cultivation. Later, with
						institutionalization, growth of monasteries, and the formation of universities,
						it seems that bhikkhus chose one camp or the other, rather than integrating
						study and practice in a personally relevant way. The Commentarial tradition that
						became dominant centuries after the Buddha, and now exists under the name
						&quot;Theravada Buddhism,&quot; has enshrined the distinction. A bhikkhu might
						take up the study approach in a city monastery for a while and then go off to
						meditate, or do the reverse, or never change. But mixing the two aspects of
						learning in the same person at the same time in the same place does not seem to
						have happened much, especially in Thailand.</p>
											<p>When Buddhadasa Bhikkhu took up earnest and solitary practice, he soon found
						that he lacked sufficient understanding to practice thoroughly, and so his
						studies continued. He realized that study and practice must guide, support, and
						correct each other. The Pali scriptures are full of practical information on all
						aspects of meditation and spiritual living. The knowledgeable and reflective
						student can find in them all the advice he needs. Meanwhile, daily practice
						enables him to distinguish what is truly relevant to his needs from what is
						inappropriate, academic, and superstitious. What remains is a simple,
						straightforward, unified approach.</p>
											<p>Suan Mokkh has reduced the number, extent, and elaborateness of traditional
						ceremonies. Rituals are not considered efficacious enough, in terms of spiritual
						development, to warrant much of the bhikkhus' energy and attention. They are not
						abandoned altogether, however, when they contain sufficient meaning, and in
						sensitivity to the feelings of those who depend on them. It is doubtful that the
						bhikkhus in the Buddha's time did anything more than simple observances on the
						Full and New Moon days. <a href="#FNGL12" name="TXTGL12"><sup class="white">12</sup></a></p>
											<p>The Thai people, like all cultures in adopting a religion, have added on
						their own seasonal holidays, folk beliefs, and customs, some of which have
						nothing to do with the Buddha or his message, and others in which the original
						meaning has been forgotten. In the first case, Suan Mokkh refuses to
						participate. No crude superstitions are tolerated, although they're always
						trying to sneak in. In the latter case, the ceremonial aspects are simplified
						and the spiritual meaning and value stressed. Thai customs are of course
						followed, but in simple ways that can support Dhamma understanding rather than
						mere emotional gratification. Not only is this approach courageous and daring
						(in any time or culture<a href="#FNGL13" name="TXTGL13"><sup class="white">13</sup></a>),
						it takes much hard work. It is no easy matter to explain the deeper significance
						of holidays and traditions to &quot;believers&quot; more intent on warm feelings
						and fun. These explanations must be repeated year after year, not only for the
						local villagers, but for school teachers, soldiers, governors, academics, monks,
						and foreign scholars.</p>
											<p>These are merely some superficial examples of Suan Mokkh's attempt to recover
						Pristine Buddhism. The most important aspect of the attempt involves taking a
						&quot;new look&quot; at the basic and essential teachings, especially those
						overlooked by traditionalists. This has stirred up the most controversy.</p>
											<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<h3>DUTY: WORK AND SERVICE</h3>
						<p>Every monastery depends on physical work, ranging from preparation of food to
						maintenance. Sometimes, the lay supporters supply and arrange for everything,
						leaving the monks to perform ceremonies, study, teach, meditate, and other such
						&quot;holy&quot; acts. More often, especially in rural areas, the monks must do
						much of the work themselves, becoming skilled, especially in construction work.
						Unfortunately, this work is seldom seen as Dhamma practice - necessary, yes;
						spiritually valuable, no. This misunderstanding can create frustration and
						confusion in the bhikkhus who must do such work and yet see it as separate from
						their spiritual practice and growth.</p>
						<p>At Suan Mokkh, any necessary work is considered a duty, and duty is one
						meaning of Dhamma. Doing duties is practicing Dhamma. Cleaning toilets, as much
						as scriptural study and meditation, is necessary, therefore important and valid
						practice. In fact, one is less likely to feel pride over a toilet properly
						scrubbed than, say giving sermons. Yet, there is a satisfaction in it that
						brings joy and serenity, which can in turn lead to deepening wisdom.</p>
						<p>In the early days, when only one or a few bhikkhus lived at Suan Mokkh, the
						work was small and could be handled easily by Ajarn Buddhadasa and anyone
						staying with him at the time. Later, as Suan Mokkh grew, there was a need for
						larger projects and coordinated work. Thus began a tradition know as Labor Day.
						Each month there are four lunar observance days. The day before each of these
						observances is an opportunity for the monks and novices to get some exercise and
						clean themselves with sweat. Our hearts are defiled by selfishness, so we clean
						them by unselfish work. Doing so once every seven or eight days doesn't take
						away from other duties and accomplishes tasks on which the Wat depends.</p>
						<p>As Suan Mokkh grew and Ajarn Buddhadasa's reputation spread, it became
						necessary for certain work to be done regularly, often daily. In an informal and
						voluntary way, different bhikkhus, and sometimes lay residents, take
						responsibility for receiving and aiding visitors, teaching individuals and
						groups, recording lectures and copying tapes, transcribing talks, translating,
						maintenance, and looking after new monks. There are no positions or offices, and
						no administrative structure. Each does work that suits his skills, interests,
						and needs, which he considers valuable and satisfying. A small group of nuns and
						lay women also help out, especially in the kitchen.</p>
						<p>One last bit of work is common to all forest Wats - sweeping the leaves,
						twigs, and branches that continually fall from our trees. Each hut has a strong
						broom (made from the ribs of palm fronds) and others are scattered liberally
						throughout the Wat. Everyone helps to keep living areas, public areas, and
						pathways clear. The never-ending task teaches patience and working for its own
						sake. This work is never finished, a leaf always falls upon the ground one has
						just swept. That's how it goes - impermanence, thusness. The value is in the
						working, in serving unselfishly: &quot;Dhamma sweeps the heart while the broom
						sweeps the ground.&quot; External cleanliness helps cultivate a clean, undefiled
						mind. And when it is done without any grasping and clinging, when there is only
						sweeping and no sweeper, then &quot;void-mind&quot; is uncovered and there is
						direct living in Dhamma.</p>

											<h2 class="text-center haveMargin" style="margin-top:30px;">TEACHING</h2>
											<hr>
						<p><img src="assets/ajarn6.jpg" alt="tan ajarn walking with cane" align="left" hspace="13" width="60%">As
						has been implied already, Suan Mokkh has always seen teaching as one of its
						duties, in fact, a central duty second only to spiritual study, practice, and
						realization. Anyone who has benefited from the teaching in some way has a duty,
						in turn, to keep those teachings alive, to pass them along to others, to
						maintain the religion. Even before founding Suan Mokkh, Buddhadasa Bhikkhus
						delivered frequent sermons at other Wats in the area. Later, he was kept quite
						busy speaking around the province, throughout the southern region, then more and
						more in Bangkok, and finally in the central and northern regions. Other monks
						from Suan Mokkh have been recognized as knowledgeable, inspiring, and creative
						speakers. Now that Ajarn Buddhadasa never travels, many of his monks, former
						students, and others influenced by him - including many lay people - are helping
						to keep alive and deepen understanding of the Buddha's Dhamma in Wats, schools,
						hospitals, government offices, non-government organizations, social activist
						circles, and Buddhist groups (often formed by the employees of medium and large
						sized companies). Suan Mokkh is by no means the only source of teaching energy,
						but the number of respected teachers - especially lay - coming from somewhere
						outside of Bangkok and outside the traditional mainstream is extraordinary. Many
						disagree with ideas coming from Suan Mokkh, but no one in Thailand can be
						indifferent to them. Over the years, controversy and criticism has lessened but
						not disappeared; this is taken to be a good sign. <a href="#FNGL14" name="TXTGL14"><font size="2"><sup class="white">14</sup></a></p>
						<p>In the past, travel to Suan Mokkh was difficult, and most of its teaching
						work was done by bhikkhus traveling to the audience. Since the building of the
						Asia Highway at our gate, and with rapid increases in bus transportation and
						personal car ownership (in addition to the rail service available since the
						beginning), the number of visitors has grown from year to year. Almost every bus
						tour group traveling south stops at least to stretch their legs. We hope that
						they can catch some peace of mind among the trees before continuing their hectic
						schedule, and when time permits, we invite them into the Spiritual Theater for
						some Dhamma nourishment. The Theater is a large hall covered on the outside with
						copies, made here, of ancient relief sculpture from the earliest Buddhist
						shrines in India and inside with an eclectic collections of paintings, original
						and copied, from all Buddhist schools, other religions, folklore, fables, and
						flower catalogues. There are always bhikkhus available to help visitors discover
						Dhamma meaning in these paintings. For most the Theater is strange but
						interesting, something that might spark some spiritual inquiry. While
						sight-seeing at Wats is common, taking the time to examine one's own heart is
						not.</p>
						<p>Housing is available for those who wish to stay longer. As in most forest
						Wats, there is no charge and no time limit. Study programs are arranged for the
						many groups that come for a few days to over a week. There are groups of high
						school and university students, teachers and civil servants, monks and novices,
						development workers and ordinary villagers, and even foreigners. Some weekends
						and during the school holidays the older bhikkhus are not given much time to
						rest. Most of the programs include an introduction to meditation and daily
						sittings. Further, meditation courses are organized regularly for foreign
						travelers, some who come out of curiosity and other who come to Thailand
						specifically to study Buddhism. The instruction is in English, with Western and
						Thai monks helping out. In turn, Thai groups have asked for similar courses in
						Thai, which now are happening as well.</p>
						<p>Another recent development of special interest is that Bangkok's oldest and
						most famous hotel, under the leadership of the personnel director, who is a
						practicing Buddhist, is bringing down groups of its own staff on a regular
						basis. The hotel has found that higher pay does not make for satisfied and happy
						staff. In fact, more money leads to more drinking, debt, and other personal and
						family problems. The response, which is popular among staff and showing positive
						results, is to help them find meaning in their lives through an understanding of
						Buddhism that goes deeper than beliefs, superstitions, and traditional
						ceremonies. The message is simple: Selfishness never brings true happiness;
						genuine unselfishness is immediately happy. Most of the staff has come, and many
						are asking for a second visit.</p>
						<p>Because Suan Mokkh is not like other Wats, many visitors are given a fresh
						look at Buddhism, especially those who have lost interest in the traditional,
						and often outdated, Wats. Suan Mokkh is more like a park; it lacks the imposing
						and expensive buildings that intimidate as much as they awe. The atmosphere is
						both informal and committed, lively and relaxed, challenging and friendly. This
						can be disarming, helping people to drop their defenses and open their hearts,
						and often kindles a bit of childlike innocence. While many merely take the
						opportunity to unwind and relax before rushing back to increasingly chaotic
						modern life (which Suan Mokkh doesn't begrudge them), some are touched
						profoundly. The work and service is its own reward, but the peace and joy in the
						eyes and smiles of others is a pleasant bonus. Suan Mokkh doesn't claim credit
						for these changes in people. They have done the work themselves and must
						continue to do so. And much of the teaching is done not by words and painting
						but by nature. Who can really know the transformation and awakening in others'
						hearts? It's enough to begin to see it in oneself and cultivate it as far toward
						selflessness as one can. Serving others serves the Dhamma, and when there is no
						&quot;self&quot; to be served there is true peace.</p>
						<hr id="monks" class="full">
											<h2 class="text-center haveMargin" style="margin-top:30px;">MONKS: NO ONE SPECIAL</h2>
											<hr>

						<p>No matter how unique, innovative, or controversial, everything and everyone
						without exception meets in Dhamma, in nature, in ordinariness. In trying to
						share our understanding of Dhamma with others, bhikkhus should not hold
						themselves up as an ideal to follow; I for one am far from ideal. We are monks,
						they are not, but our common humanity runs deeper than any distinction. There is
						only one truth, one Law; the Buddha's teaching speaks to all human beings.
						Naturally, the circumstances of our lives must vary and so too our approaches to
						Dhamma. We each must realize our own duty, no one is &quot;holier&quot; than
						another. Too often, the &quot;full-time religious&quot; (do any truly live their
						religion full-time to the depths of the heart?) are put on a pedestal to be
						respected, even worshipped, leaving the worshipper feeling lower and lesser and
						confused. Humility is proper, but denigration one's own spiritual potential
						kills. As much as Thai custom allows, Suan Mokkh tries to avoid putting the
						monks above others. The need is for everyone to bow to the Dhamma in their own
						hearts. Bowing to anything else is superstition.</p>
						<p>To avoid becoming special, to perform its duty successfully, the Wat must be
						relevant. Thai Wats used to be the center of village life and traditional Thai
						culture. With rapid modernization, capitalization, and urbanization, the Wats
						tend to be more and more on the fringe, except when they are co-opted. They are
						kept separate for special days and activities, rather than being a vital part of
						daily life. Sometimes a Wat tries to get up-to-date with gadgets, marketing, and
						slang. Usually it gets swept along and loses its spiritual grounding. Or it just
						holds tight to its traditions and watches the congregation get old, then burns
						them one by one.</p>
						<p>When the Wat, church, or synagogue can no longer speak its rightful message
						in terms coherent to its community, then society becomes dead within its heart.
						The challenge in these increasingly confusing, materialistic, and selfish times
						is to keep the spirit alive and to rejuvenate the traditions, to maintain the
						spiritual ground and to speak with the community in spiritually practical words.
						Suan Mokkh is determined to keep pace with the rapid changes in society, not
						merely to be modern, not to follow, but to lead. No one thinks it is easy to do
						so. We must be dedicated, sensitive, open, inspired, creative, and on-the-ball.
						No matter, we prefer this most difficult service work - teaching Dhamma and all
						the inner work it entails - to watching our friends rot in a spiritually
						meaningless world.</p>
						<hr id="resolutions" class="full">
											<h2 class="text-center haveMargin" style="margin-top:30px;">RESOLUTIONS</h2>
											<hr>
						<p>For many years Suan Mokkh has operated in line with &quot;Three
						Resolutions.&quot; These are to try our best
							<ul>
						  <li valign="top" width="100%"><p>To help everyone penetrate to the heart of their own religion;</p></li>
						  <li valign="top" width="100%"><p>To create mutual good understanding among all religions;</p></li>
						  <li valign="top" width="100%"><p>To work together to drag the world out from materialism.</p></li>
						  </ul>
						<p>Muslims and Christians, the main religious minorities in Siam, all religious
						people, and even those who shun religion have always been welcome here. Out of
						curiosity, goodwill, and necessity, Suan Mokkh wishes to meet with all
						religions. The basic principle is to establish mutual good understanding. This
						means that each party expresses its spiritual understanding as clearly as it
						can, with all other parties listening open-mindedly. There is friendly give and
						take. Agreement is not expected but is found where possible. Differences are
						noted, but the emphasis is on what we have in common and what each can
						contribute to the battle against selfishness. There is no wish to form some One
						World Religion. People have different cultures, backgrounds, education levels,
						and mental abilities. Therefore, a variety of religions is necessary. The key is
						to prevent that variety from being a source of competition, argument, and
						conflict.</p>
						<p>Suan Mokkh's emphasis on nature helps the dialogue. Everyone can appreciate
						this most common denominator. No religion claims nature for its own; we can all
						respect, share, and learn from it together. Self-reliance and responsibility, no
						side setting itself up as teacher, openness and freedom of thought, dedication
						to hard work and service to humanity, simplicity, and directness: All these are
						qualities that will help each of us to get to the deepest spiritual core of our
						traditions. Then we can met without fears and schemes in true sisterhood and
						brotherhood. And for those who dare, the fresh look Suan Mokkh takes at Buddhism
						can explore all traditions.</p>
						<p>Suan Mokkh's latest project is the development of an International Dharma
						hermitage. One of its uses will be for holding meditation courses and group
						trainings. Ajarn Buddhadasa is most interested, however in using it to bring
						together spiritual people from all of Thailand's religions to further mutual
						good understanding and cooperation against rampant materialism and moral decay.
						If such meeting are successful, and they will not be so difficult to arrange, he
						would hope to do the same on an international scale. For now, Suan Mokkh is
						waiting to see who is interested.</p>
