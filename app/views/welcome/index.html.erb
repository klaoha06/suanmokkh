He found the Wats (temples) there dirty, crowded, and corrupt, nothing like the purer, more simple Buddhism of his birthplace. Thus, returned to the South and moved into an abandoned temple near his hometown. At first living alone, then with others as news of his experiment spread, he took a radical look into the sources of Theravada Buddhism and dedicated his life to following the pristine Dhamma and correcting the numerous mistaken beliefs and practices that had crept in over the centuries. Some hated him, others loved him. Why not see what he has to offer? See below for some of his teachings.</p>

				Add one measure of the bark of "don't know nothing."<br>
				Add one measure of the heartwood of "the heck with it."<br>
				Add one measure of the root of "that's just how it is."<br>
				Add one measure of the leaves of "without any 'me' or 'mine'."<br>
				Add one measure of the flowers of "nothing worth being or having."<br>
				Add one measure of the fruit of "die before dying." <br>
				<br>
				Equal measures of these six makes a total of six measures together. <br>
				<br>
				Add the seed of "remainderless quenching" equal to the rest (six measures).<br>
				Bless these medicines with 108 repetitions of the mantra sabbe dhamma nalam abhinivesaya*.<br>

				Place them all in a ceramic boiling pot and cover with water. Boil the liquid down to a third.<br>
				<br>
				Drink three times a day. Don't forget! One teaspoon each time is enough. You'll be cleared of the disease most terrifying for us.<br>
				<br>
				If you aren't cured in a month, continue taking for a year. If you aren't cured after a year, you're crazy and can stop taking it.<br>
				<br>
				* Nothing is worth clinging to.</p>

Per­mis­sion will readily be granted to dedi­cated medi­tators and students of Buddhism. Doing a chore (com­mu­nity work like sweeping leaves) while staying is part of the practice.
				Ac­com­mo­dation in dorms (for men) or in­di­vid­ual rooms (for wom­en) is free; food is avail­able inside the mon­as­tery or at the nearby stalls.
				Please note that there are neither organised activities nor a certain schedule to be fol­lowed, no teachings or instructions been offered while staying at the main Suan Mokkh monastery. This possibility is therefore most suitable for people who have done a retreat at the In­ter­na­tional Dharma Hermitage already or for experienced med­ita­tors who can use the wat's facilities without guidance.</p>
